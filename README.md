I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System

### Project Scope

- Study Lab 4 base code for calculator
- Implement additional features to calculator

### Expected Behavior

    - TBD

### Base operations

    - Addition
    - Subtraction

### Additional operations

    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Exponentiation
    - Modulo
    - Remainder
    - Squaring
    - Square Root (Non Restoring)

### Slide Switch Toggle

    - Use slide switches to toggle between operations
    - No Switches 
        - BTNU = Addition Operation
        - BTND = Subtraction Operation
    - Switch 0
        - BTNU = Multiplication Operation
        - BTND = Division Operation
    - Switch 1
        - BTNU = Exponentiation Operation
        - BTND = Modulo Operation 
    -Switch 2
        - BTNU = Squaring Operation
        - BTND = Square Root Operation

### Running Operations

    - Allow the calculator to perform running operations
    - (Continuous operations based on previous computation results)
