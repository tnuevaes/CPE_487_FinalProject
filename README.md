## Teddy Nueva Espana

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System

### Project Scope

- Study Lab 4 base code for calculator
- Implement additional features to calculator

### Expected Behavior
- Base operations
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
- Additional operations
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Exponentiation
    - Modulo
    - Remainder

- Slide switches to toggle between addition and subtraction operations
    - Switch 0
        - BTNU = Addition Operation
        - BTND = Subtraction Operation
    - Switch 1
        - BTNU = Multiplication Operation
        - BTND = Division Operation
    - Switch 2
        - BTNU = Exponentiation Operation
        - BTND = Modulo Operation 

- Running Operations
    - Allow the calculator to perform running operations (Continuous operations based on previous computation results)
